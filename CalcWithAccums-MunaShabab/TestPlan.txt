*Created the form with all the controls and tested it
*started by declaring the field variables and initializing them
*created the click event for the calculate button 
*declared the variables needed to hold the the values 
*assigned the values to the variables from the text boxes and tested that
*performed the calculations and displayed the results for the group boxes
*displaed the rest of the lables and did the calculation for the remaining truck capacity 
*tested for the different remaining capacity, above or below zero and the display of the backColor for the lable
*created the click event for the clear button and tested it , it worked
*I was trying to show the program to someone and accidentally did something in the code, I used the undo button, but then the clear button 
stopped working and I couldnt tell why, so I had to creat a new click event and deleted the old one.It worked .
* I had forgotten to set the text property of the order count to "", so it displayed the current order count instead of zero, so I thought 
that reseting the values was not working (I tried setting a breakpoint and ran the code line by line and checked variable values),
Then I tried entering new data and the reset was fine.
